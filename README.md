# Email Classification

This project focuses on classifying emails into two categories using BERT. The notebook walks through the steps of preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and the implementation of classification models. The dataset contains email data with text and corresponding labels.

- The labels represent categories such as spam, ham.

## Steps

1. **Data Loading**: Load the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.
2. **Text Preprocessing**:
   - Tokenization
   - Stopword removal
   - Stemming/Lemmatization
3. **EDA**:
   - Visualizing email categories
   - Analyzing word frequencies
   - Checking class distributions
4. **Feature Extraction**:
   - Converting text data into numerical representations using techniques such as TF-IDF or Count Vectorization.
5. **Model Training**:
   - Train machine learning models such as Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or SVM.
   - Hyperparameter tuning for optimal performance.
6. **Evaluation**:
   - Measure model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
